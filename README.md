This homework assignment was to modify the Javasctipt file to create a password generator. The user will be prompted to input the number of characters that the password will be. Any number between 8 and 128. The user will then be propted to choose if they would like numbers, upper case letters, lower case letters or symbols. Once selected, the browser will generate a password base on user input and choices.


This assignmt showed the importance of computer logic, I had to figure out how to break down the issue in plain english, get a order of operation, then translate it to where the computer could understand and excute the code. Working through the issues of this assignment also revealed that I have a long way to go to truly understand javascript to its core so I can efficiently breakdown, write and execute the code.
